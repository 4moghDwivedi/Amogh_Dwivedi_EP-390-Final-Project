# EP-390 Final Project
 "Amogh's first and final instrument during his studies at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts!"


## User Manual

This instrument/composition so far is really centered around the idea of the environment affecting the nature of the generative composition. The user may cover the photo resistor, or try to generate heat near the temperature sensor in order to get some potential changes in timbre.

I would additionally like to include a sensor that measures water level, as well as an ultrasonic sensor that could add another layer of musical depth. I have not done this yet, as most of my protoype was ceneterd around focusing on the software portion. But it's on its way for sure!!
